If we read the arm cortex m4 instruction set manual, there are some restrictions
mentioned with the use of IF-THEN-ELSE and one of them says "each instruction 
inside the IT block must specify a condition code suffix that is either the same
 or logical inverse".

In code-2, the instructions inside the IF-THEN-ELSE block have a condition code 
suffix 'LT' associated with instructions ADD, MOV and 'GE' with instruction SUB
which is consistent with the 'IT' condition. However in code-1, there  is no 
condition suffix with the instructions inside if then else block. That's  why 
there is an error "Specified condition is not consistent with previous IT".

Also, While using IF-THEN-ELSE the condition code suffix for ELSE statements 
must be inverse of THEN statements. For example GE is inverse of LT as can be 
seen in code-2.
