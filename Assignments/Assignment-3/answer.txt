1.) Yes.
The fractional part plays role in defining the precision of a number. Number
precision is defined as the maximum number of digits/bits present in a number. 
The mantissa/significand is composed of an implicit(meaning no need to store it) 
leading bit (left of radix point) and the fraction bits (to the right of radix 
point). For example, we have a number which is represented as 1.101 * 2^2 (6.5 
in decimal).
Now,
Mantissa - 1.101
implicit leading bit - 1
fraction bits - .101
Precision - 4 (containing 4 bits i.e one leading bit and three fraction bits)
Precision is important to avoid loss of information. The single precision has
23 bits whereas double precision has 52 bits. So more is the number of fractional
bits, more is the precision.

2.) In the IEEE754 standard, the floating point numbers are stored as binary
scientific notation given as " x = M * 2^e ". Here the 'M' stands for mantissa
and 'e' stands for the exponent. Now the exponent can be chosen in a way so that
1 <= M < 2 or we can write in a general way 1 <= M < B, where "B" stands for
radix/base. So there are numbers which are bigger than zero but smaller than
1.0 * 2^emin. Those numbers are called the subnormal numbers. It is basically a
non-zero floating point number which has a magnitude less than the magnitude of
smallest normal number. All the exponent bits and leading hidden bits are zero.
Normal number is a non-zero floating point number with a magnitude greater than
or equal to minimum value B^emin, where B is the radix/base and "emin is the 
minimum exponent.

    <----- Subnormals -----> | <----- Normal Numbers ----->

3.) Out of the five methods defined by IEEE for rounding off the floating point
numbers, the first two rules round to the nearest value and the other three are
called directed rounding.
a.) Round to nearest, ties to even
    If a number lies midway, it is often rounded to the nearest value with an
    even least significant digit.
    Example : +9.5 -> +10.0
              +10.5-> +10.0
              -9.5 -> -10.0
              -10.5-> -10.0
    The nonzero digit of a number that is farthest left is called most
    significant digit, and the nonzero digit farthest right is called the Least
    significant digit.
b.) Round to nearest, ties away from zero
    If a number lies midway, it is rounded to the nearest value above if it is a
    positive number or below if it is a negative number.
    Example : +9.5 -> +10.0
              +10.5-> +11.0
              -9.5 -> -10.0
              -10.5-> -11.0
c.) Rounding toward 0
    The number is directly rounded toward 0.  
    Example : +9.5 -> +9.0
              +10.5-> +10.0
              -9.5 -> -9.0
              -10.5-> -10.0
d.) Rounding toward +∞
    The number is directly rounded toward positive infinity. It is also known as
    rounding up or ceiling.
    Example : +9.5 -> +10.0
              +10.5-> +11.0
              -9.5 -> -9.0
              -10.5-> -10.0
e.) Rounding toward -∞
    The number is directly rounded toward negative infinity. It is also known as
    rounding down or floor.
    Example : +9.5 -> +9.0
              +10.5-> +10.0
              -9.5 -> -10.0
              -10.5-> -11.0
