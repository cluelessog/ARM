1.) Yes.
The fractional part plays role in defining the precision of a number. Number
precision is defined as the maximum number of digits/bits present in a number. 
The mantissa/significand is composed of an implicit(meaning no need to store it) 
leading bit (left of radix point) and the fraction bits (to the right of radix 
point). For example, we have a number which is represented as 1.101 * 2^2 (6.5 
in decimal).
Now,
Mantissa - 1.101
implicit leading bit - 1
fraction bits - .101
Precision - 4 (containing 4 bits i.e one leading bit and three fraction bits)
Precision is important to avoid loss of information.

2.) In the IEEE754 standard, the floating point numbers are stored as binary
scientific notation given as " x = M * 2^e ". Here the 'M' stands for mantissa
and 'e' stands for the exponent. Now the exponent can be chosen in a way so that
1 <= M < 2 or we can write in a general way 1 <= M < B, where "B" stands for
radix/base. So there are numbers which are bigger than zero but smaller than
1.0 * 2^emin. Those numbers are called the subnormal numbers. It is basically a
non-zero floating point number which has a magnitude less than the magnitude of smallest normal number.
Normal number is a non-zero floating point number with a magnitude greater than
or equal to minimum value B^emin, where B is the radix/base and "emin is the 
minimum exponent.
